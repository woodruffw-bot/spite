# Test262 regression fixtures

These 28 unmodified fixtures come from
[tc39/test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) at the commit in `REVISION`.
`manifest.tsv` records each upstream path, test mode, and SHA-256 digest.
`LICENSE` is the upstream BSD license. Each fixture retains its copyright notice.

## Script smoke tests

Eleven hashbang fixtures use the `raw` flag. The integration test in `spite` runs
each positive case once in a fresh realm without changing its source or adding a
harness. Negative cases must fail during parsing with a syntax diagnostic at the
misplaced hash character. Unsupported functionality and unrelated syntax failures
fail the regression test.

## Identifier component tests

Thirteen fixtures test the lexer directly in `spite-parser`. Eight files form
literal/escaped pairs for Unicode 16 and 17 identifier additions. Each pair must
produce identical decoded tokens. These inputs cover 8,949 identifier starts and
two identifiers containing the additional ID_Continue characters. Five negative
fixtures must reject the exact invalid identifier escape with the expected
message and source span.

These are lexer regressions, not passing Script tests. The original sources use
syntax such as var whose execution is not implemented. They are never rewritten
to make them executable, and they do not contribute to an execution pass count.
Unicode 18 additions are covered separately by the pinned UCD tables and local
parser tests. Each test group checks its reviewed manifest inventory.

## Statement parser tests

Four `noStrict` fixtures cover the `let` lookahead rules in while and if bodies.
The parser receives each complete, unchanged source. Tests check that ASI leaves
`let` as an identifier expression and that the following block or assignment
becomes a separate statement. These are parser regressions only; they do not run
the Test262 harness or count as full Script execution passes.

## Scope and maintenance

The manifest is not a YAML metadata parser or a general Test262 runner. These
results do not measure whole-suite conformance. Other tests require grammar,
objects, functions, or harness facilities that have not been implemented yet.
The general runner remains on the roadmap.

Run `python3 tools/check-test262.py` to verify the vendored bytes. Git attributes
prevent line-ending normalization of fixtures. Do not edit the source files to
make the engine pass. When updating the pin, copy the selected files unchanged,
review their metadata, update hashes and expectations, and rerun the checks.
